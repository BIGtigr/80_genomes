80 genomes
==============
Python programs written to find gene loss and gain between genomes


Requirements
==============

  - Python 2.7 or higher  `pythonbrew <https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew/>`_
  - `FuzzyWuzzy <https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy>`_

Run
============

python create_clusters.py
+++++++


Searches annotation files for a term/regex expression and 
returns protein cluster files that contain the term alongÂ·
with any additional terms for that cluster. Returns summary files containing clade 
information on presence or abasance of genes 
 
  - cluster_summary.txt
  - clade_summary.txt

Example::

  python create_cluster_files.py --term 'signal transduction' --cluster /EightyHalophiles/FilteredHomology/HomologyClusters_I20.txt --anno /EightyHalophiles/Annotations/


- --term grabs all annotations containing this term
- --cluster path to cluster file
- --anno directory containing annotation files


find_local_dups.py
++++++

finds localdups of a gene looks up and downstream for genes in same
cluster on same scaffold and within a certain distance from on another. Returns cluster file with number of local dups found for each cluster.

  - cluster_dups.txt

Example::

  python find_local_dups.py --cluster "cluster_data/" --pad 2000

- --cluster: path to cluster_data dir
- --pad bps to look up and downstream gene for local dups
